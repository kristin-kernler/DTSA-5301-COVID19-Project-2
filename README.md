DTSA 5301 Final Project 2: Reproducible Report on COVID19 Data

## Project Purpose

This is the Final Project for the course DTSA 5301: Data Science as a Field. We are demonstrating our ability to complete all steps in the data science process by producing a report on the COVID19 data set from the John Hopkins github site.

## Project Instructions
Import, tidy and analyze the COVID19 dataset from the Johns Hopkins github site. This is the same dataset I used in class. Feel free to repeat and reuse what I did if you want to.  Be sure your project is reproducible and contains some visualization and analysis that is unique to your project. You may use the data to do any analysis that is of interest to you. You should include at least two visualizations and one model.  Be sure to identify any bias possible in the data and in your analysis.  

## Grading Criteria

1. Results are reproducible.
2. Report contains a clear statement of the question of interest.
3. A source and a short description of the data should be provided.
4. Report must contain at least 2 visualizations.
5. Report is clearly written and free of grammatical errors.
6. Report contains at least one model of the data.
7. Report contains an analysis beyond what was done in the class lectures.
8. Does the report have a conclusion and are possible sources of bias identified?

## About Data

Two of the datasets are time series tables for the US confirmed cases and deaths, reported at the county level.

The other two datasets are for the global confirmed cases and deaths. Australia, Canada, and China are reported at the province/state level. Dependencies of the Netherlands, the UK, France and Denmark are listed under the province/state level. The uS and other countries are at the country level.

The data is updated once a day around 23:59 (UTC).

## Question of Interest

- Which Wisconsin county has the highest mortality rate and which Wisconsin county has the lowest mortality rate?
- Can we predict future Wisconsin COVID19 cases and deaths with a Linear Regression Model?
